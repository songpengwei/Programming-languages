Now consider the effect of performing an arithmetic right shift on a two’scomplement
number. For a positive number, we have 0 as the most significant bit,
and so the effect is the same as for a logical right shift. Thus, an arithmetic right
shift by k is the same as division by 2k for a nonnegative number.As an example of
a negative number, Figure 2.28 shows the effect of applying arithmetic right shift
to a 16-bit representation of−12,340 for different shift amounts.Aswe can see, the
result is almost the same as dividing by a power of 2. For the case when no rounding
is required (k = 1), the result is correct. But when rounding is required, shifting
causes the result to be rounded downward rather than toward zero, as should be
the convention. For example, the expression -7/2 should yield -3 rather than -4.
