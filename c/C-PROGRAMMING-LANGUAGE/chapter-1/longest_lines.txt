Since things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too.
Accordingly, let us first write a separate function getline to fetch the next line
of input. We will try to make the function useful in other contexts, 
At the minimum, getline has to return a signal about possible end of file; a more
useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if end of file is
encountered, Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid 
line length, Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing 
only a newline has length 1.
